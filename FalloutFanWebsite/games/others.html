                One of the military vaults located in California emerged from the war determined to restore 
                civilization. Using their superior weapons, they were able to reclaim 
                the surrounding wasteland. The members of this vault formed the 
                Brotherhood of Steel, an organization dedicated to restoring 
                civilization and reclaiming or developing new and better technologies.

            <h1>Fallout: Botherhood of Steel</h1>
            <p>
                Released on January 14, 2004, Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel was 
                the fourth video game to be set in the Fallout universe. It was 
                also the first to be made for consoles, and the last to be made 
                during Interplay's initial run on the series, before the rights 
                passed to Bethesda Softworks. The game chronicles the adventures
                 of an initiate in the fictional Brotherhood of Steel, a militant 
                 quasi-religious organization that has come to power in a 
                 post-apocalyptic world.

                    Fallout 76 is a narrative prequel to previous Fallout games. It is set 
                    in an alternate history, and takes place in 2102, twenty-five years 
                    after a nuclear war that devastated the Earth. The player character is 
                    a resident of Vault 76, a fallout shelter that was built in West 
                    Virginia to house America's best and brightest minds. The player 
                    character exits the Vault on "Reclamation Day" as part of a plan to 
                    re-colonize the Wasteland.
